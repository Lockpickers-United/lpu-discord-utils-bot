I helped <@270551142860193793> with Kwikset SmartKeys Gen 1/2 & 3, though I‚Äôm not sure in the end if he was able to get the Gen 1/2 open as our communication slowed. I provided <@676078933996863498> with an in depth, systematic approach to picking Kwikset SmartKey Gen 1/2 locks, which I believe were fruitful in the end. After my initial discussion with them, I didn‚Äôt hear back, so I‚Äôm hopeful that what I provided was detailed enough for them to get an open. I‚Äôve also shared my experience in the making of the tool for a Kwikset SmartKey Gen 3 including measurements, techniques, materials, and how to best use it for successful opens. There are also a number of questions I‚Äôve answered from people on Reddit, though there are too many posts on which I‚Äôve commented to name them all. The ones I feel are more towards the side of mentoring were replies to posts I had made where people wanted additional information on how to get those specific locks open."

I'm requesting Blue Belt for picking and gutting a Paclock 90A-Pro - https://youtu.be/BkjS7V72FI8 For evidence of helping out new pickers, here's one from this morning but I can provide many more if needed. -https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/124j8hb/first_lock_picked_abus_64ti30/\nFor the Challenge Lock (called \"Tic-1\"), it's a Schlage Everest (not Primus) and is heavily modified. I've sent the lock to DoctorHogMaster for his review and slaughter. üôÇ Below is a link to the images. All driver/key pins were modified using a Dremel/hacksaw/razor saw. Plug was threaded on all 6 chambers. Chamber 3 was counter-milled. And testing the limits of my creativity, I had some flair (tic tac toe etching). - https://imgur.com/gallery/PmjJBmb\n\nHere's doctorhogmaster‚Äôs pick/gut of the CL:  \nPick&Gut\nPlease let me know if I've missing anything,\nThanks, David"

A great many moons ago, MaxVal picked, gutted, and reassembled on video a mow1100 that was shilled to him from the great Canadian laser table of <@!388180302763130891> himself - with a core provided by the recently-minted black belt <@!94590294061748224> .  These accomplishments were deemed worthy of a green belt.  MaxVal has also assisted pickers both on Reddit and Discord when his scant skills were of help.\n\nWith the generous assistance of <@!694175792397287495>, <@!404971329209761792>, and <@!751743523698507888> MaxVal has now created the challenge lock, ‚ÄúBare Minimum‚Äù, consisting of 5 homemade driver pins, 3 modified key pins, a hand cut key, and an engraved lock body.  The incredible <@!374231121602281493> has received the lock, where it awaits his attention in fear of his awesome prowess with a pick.\n\nMaxVal humbly prays that the almighty LPU mods see fit to grant him the rank of blue belt, but if his accomplishments should be deemed not worthy, he pleads that the mods should be swift, harsh, and specific with their criticisms.\n\nSubmitted this 5th day of March 2022 by your humble apprentice of the locks,\n\nMaxVal\n\nmow1100 Pick and Gut:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_K0b7_XTctU\n\n‚ÄúBare Minimum‚Äù Challenge Lock Innards:\n||https://imgur.com/a/4c8NpUX||"

    "content": "The American CL Master has taken a break from picking CL and decided to finish his journey! First off, I would like to say that this has been an amazing journey and I am deeply blessed to be part of this community. I have met so many amazing people and learned so much that it is amazing. I am still constantly learning and growing due to the amazing people in the community. I would like to give a big special thanks to the four pickmen, <@706537873322672210> , <@!702305699396583507>, <@!589578995872432357>, and <@!791855263878479902>. Without you guys I wouldn‚Äôt be as motivated as I am, and you all have taught me a lot. I would also like to thank <@!440004220981084160>, he has been an amazing hype man and friend as he is alway keeping me focused on the end goal. Below are my requirements fulfilled for my black belt. Thank you for taking the time to review them and I hope you have a wonderful day.\n\nTelanis Roon\n\nDemonstrate your ability to gut locks and get them back together again\n\nI am constantly gutting and assembling challenge locks and stock locks on my youtube channel.\n\n2. Demonstrated history of helping advancing and advanced pickers\n\nAlthough my participation on the reddit has waned over time, I am still very active on Discord in the LPU lounge helping other pickers.\n\n3. Have built a \"Challenge Lock\" and shared it with a fellow picker\n\nAlthough I have picked over 100 CL‚Äôs, I only make a select few. The most recent one I have made was in collaboration with <@771827386903691294>  called Golden Sun and Silver Moon. This CL was sent to <@!796113103301115954> and <@!440004220981084160>.\n\n4. Have made at least one specialized tool and published the specs\n\nFor my custom tool I made a custom 3ks pick. Below is a link to the picture of the pick and schematic.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/oemfhaoomk77ns8/IMG_6318.HEIC?dl=0\n\n5. Mentor at least two advanced pickers through the process of getting into a difficult lock\n\nFor this requirement I mentored <@!702305699396583507> and <@!751743523698507888> on how to get into their Izis lock. This was done before the downgrade of the lock happened.\n\n6. Complete at least two of the \"Epic Quest Options‚Äù\n\nFor my two epic quests I completed two master projects. The first master project I completed was building a lock from scratch. My journey in completing this can be found in the playlist below.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ5ZcoSidSGNNvhQUfY4sEuVFP4dDIqR_\n\nMy second master quest I completed was the formation of SpeedLocks. This project was completed in collaboration with <@!791855263878479902> and <@!375322403141844992>. Below is our discord in which we currently have 125 members and our website.\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/YkXyZrBPrh\nWebsite: https://speedlocks.org/\n\nEdit: in the off chance that SpeedLocks does not count, I also did impressioning at the LPU meetup 2021 which can be verified by <@!314930188263751680> and <@!254053792847364096>\n\n7. SPP and gut two different locks\n\nFor this requirement I SPP‚Äôd the Assa Twin 6000 with Gins, and the Z Line Series Goal 7, which was approved by <@!458324127477137418>. See below for video proof.\n\nAssa Twin 6000 with Gins\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAd5VHkAEhE\n\nZ Line Series Goal 7\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb0R-Jd19nM"

Make a couple of spools, a couple of serrated, and then just mess around with silly shapes. You'll make a couple of non-viable pins, and then you know what *not* to do.\n\nHere's my first pins for reference; they don't have to be neat or even make much sense, as in the case of my one modded keypin: https://i.imgur.com/AoYvCPU.jpg\n\nTag me in lounge or in a DM when you reply, so we don't fill this chat up on norlin"

I helped u/jercx about a year ago with Xmas tree pins and float picking technique to get into his 700 and around the same time advised / provided  tips to u/DenBrass on primus ( even though not sure he got a open ) \nI am regularly helping members of the Official 4 Pickmen which is a glorified text stream which I formed and we meet ( remotely )  at least weekly to help push one another at whatever they are working on and to collaborate on giveaways and discuss what‚Äôs going on in the community. We also pool together to get rare locks and share ideas on how to better the community. We also send care packages to those in the community for their achievements or failures such as the rattle club. Out of all the above accomplishments being a part of this group is what I value and cherish the most. The four Pickmen consist of DustyNWindy, GeorgiaJim, RoonPicker, & Reid and myself . They have helped me in my pursuit of black and I have humbly given them tips in advancing there picking and getting into difficult locks . \n\n I believe this meets all the requirements of achieving black belt ranking. I appreciate your time as you review the information and I am excited to be acknowledged as a black belt picker. \n\nSincerely \n\n Mr. Paradise \naka\n u/PickInParadise"

I'm new to discord and didn't understand how it works. This matches my reddit username and is my more-used account. Can I re-submit my belt request with the same images?  I'm sorry for the trouble... if it's too much hassle I'm perfectly willing to re-pick the lock and post new pics.\n\nHere is the original album from earlier today. If it serves as more proof, I edited the comment on the 150 picked pic to show this is also me. \n\nFeel free to remove <@561867806409359371> 's belt to keep it kosher. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/rTGJwLm"

(https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/6g7r03/6pin_eurlock_with_security_pins/)\n\nWondering what belt entitlement this grants and whether you can update my profile with it? :)\n\n(Also /u/flarestarwingz picked this exact lock yesterday and posted the video, too)\n\nCheers!"
